TODO:

   - Add new users
   - Create form with questions 
   - Allow users to make plans with specific users by username
   - Get the responses of those forms
   - Process the responses and return the results
   - Once the user chooses another user, bring them to a screen so they can form a study plan
   - Study plan is a sort of checklist
   - individual plans vs group plans
   - resource locking, only when all subscribers to a plan have finished the task for a given time can
   they get access to.

Database schema (we can talk about this):

   - Gets complicated when a user can subscribe to multiple plans (i.e one for studying, one for dieting, etc). 

   - Basic idea:
   - Table: Users
     - user_id
     - name
     - username
     - email address
     - Foreign Key: plan_id
     - response_vec (a vector of their responses)
   - Table: Plans:
     - plan_id
     - actual plan (has to be serialized somehow I guess
