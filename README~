TODO:

   - Create form with questions (I'll provide them to you over facebook)
   - Get the responses of those forms
   - Process the responses and return the results
   - Once the user chooses another user, bring them to a screen so they can form a study plan
   - Study plan is a sort of checklist

Database schema (we can talk about this):

   - Gets complicated when a user can subscribe to multiple plans (i.e one for studying, one for dieting, etc). Maybe use Firebase and do something similar to what we did for Simplr?
